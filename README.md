# MatOps

**MatOps** is a lightweight web application for performing common matrix operations such as determinant, trace, rank, inverse, adjoint, and matrix arithmetic.  
It is designed to help students **verify their matrix solutions quickly and visually** while learning linear algebra.

The project is built entirely using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with no external libraries or frameworks.

## 🧠 Motivation

While studying linear algebra, I found it difficult to quickly verify my matrix solutions without using heavy tools or scattered online calculators.  
MatOps was built to solve that problem — a **simple, focused, and distraction-free tool** for checking matrix computations.
